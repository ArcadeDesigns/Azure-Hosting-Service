                      Search engine optimization and its vast importance to the generation of website traffic and search engine hits can never be over stated. From the importance of page structure, to proper naming of header tags and labels to the inclusion of sitemaps and proper algorithmic arrangement of contents articles and flow of web pages, search engine optimization needs them all because it is serious business. The World Wide Web is engrossed in myriads of knowledge and information’s about topics and critical researches done by others or contents written by authors or locations of important events and directions, it is undoubted that the main dissemination hub of the twenty first (21st century) century is the internet (World Wide Web), filled with thousands and millions and billions of Blogs, Websites, Or Vlogs, all with an agenda to promote, monetirize content and make prominent an ideological belief, or render services or serve as an hub of communication between the people and the important aspect of their lives, whichever way you view the World Wide Web, trying to come out on top of all of this in search engines and remain relevant can be quite difficult to engage in, however with proper understanding of the principles of Search Engine Optimization, this can be done easily. The process of optimizing web content lies in both the in depth understand of what SEO’s are used for and how it can be achieved. In a bid to understand to the fullest “Search Engine Optimization” and the process involved in achieving a satisfactory Google ranking through SEO’s, we’ll discuss important aspects of this starting with the know to the unknown;
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Hash Tags and Social Media Sharing</h4>

                    <p> 
                      Hash Tags are as important as Meta Tags in Search Engine Optimization. Hash Tags are majorly relevant only to Social Media’s and other online platforms that support it. Once a post is made and shared frequently understand specific well sort after “Hash Tags” which have constituted a verse of trending topics and argument, post under such Tags are guaranteed to get Search hits and as a result remain relevant even after a long period of time however frequent follow ups on subsequent post are highly recommended, and updates on them as well. The intention is to stay afloat all other post and contents at this same remain relevant.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Importance of Google Console and Sitemap</h4>

                    <p>
                      Definitely involved in the process of Search Engine Optimization are the duo operations of Google Console and SiteMap.xml. Google Console is like a registration agency, that recognizes a website and ensures that it analyze the website important pages, before ranking it and ensuring they get search hit on topics relating to the Website. Google Console operations are very important in SEO’s, imagine having a beautiful house warming party but without the guest showing up, in this case the beautiful house is a website, well built, and focused upon by the developer with the inclusion of all the necessary Meta Tag information’s and code, however after launching lacks access to Google search hit, or rankings. To get search hits on Google Engine, the website needs to be registered on Google Console and to do this, the website needs a sitemap. Just like the name implies, a site map is an xml file that gives search engine an analytical result on what pages are importance and what pages are not. The sitemap.xml file in uploaded into the root of the host platform of the website and is connected to Google console, which in turn would make the website visible in search engines and guarantees a Google ranking. Of course for higher ranking on Google and more search hits, a proper Meta Tag information is needed, as well as written contents, plagiarism free and well researched with the right vocabulary expressions and grammatical structure as contents with high informative quality are guaranteed to get higher Google search ranking.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Making Use of Meta Tags</h4>

                    <p>
                      Hash Tags are important, Plagiarism free high quality contents are also important, Google Console and sitemap are important, but all this things won’t matter without proper Meta Tag information. Imagine building a beautiful house, with beautiful designs but in the end, it lacks electricity, of course during the day, if an housing warming party is held, the guest would be present, but at noon and night when the lights should be turned on to attract attention and admiration, there is no electricity, that’s on important Meta Tags are. Meta Tags are used to describe the necessary and basic information about a website and give it a more meaningful approach to the view of the World. Without Meta Tags then it is impossible for websites to get search hits, or for Google Console to ascertain what the website is all about. Even more Meta Tags are used to set targets for the desired audience and get relevant keywords concerning that field or contents written. When working with the Meta Tag information, there are certain information’s that should be given strict attention to, namely; the Meta Tag Descriptions, Keywords and Title. The Meta Tag Description is used to describe how the website looks like and what is entails, while the Tag Title, is used to reflect meaningful headings and sub headings in the contents on the web page, and the Tag Keywords are used to ensure the page gets search hits on trending keywords listed in them. Basically, the Meta Tag information defined the website and gives it true finishing touch.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">The Importance of Keywords:</h4>

                    <p>
                      As important as the Meta Tag description and tiles are, the Meta Tag Keywords are also very much important. Following the research of Ahref, Meta Tag keywords constitute a large part of the Meta information and ensures Search engines recognizes the Web page among the thousands of Web pages in line with such Search. The Meta Tag keywords can be gotten by search online for trending website keywords or by using Ahref and other SEO’s expert agencies to ascertain the trending keyword and ensure effective usage. Without the proper and best keywords to match the web content, then it becomes difficult to rank on Google top pages and SEO’s are not implemented fully. Imagine this, the description and owners of a house are well know and are preparing for a wedding, however haven’t sent out any invitation and are expecting guest, with the few invitations sent, were delivered to the wrong people; thus without Meta Tag keywords, traffic can’t be generated and without the focus on targeted audience, traffic can’t be retained.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Content Writing</h4>

                    <p>
                      Content writing on the other hand is an important aspect of Website management. Imagine running a website with on content to post, definitely leading to the fall and failure of the Website. Besides, Google Console would make use of the Website content to rank the website and ensure it appears on search engine results. High quality, plagiarism free Websites are important to maintain a positive Google Website ranking and ensure continuous traffic to the Website.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Page Structure</h4>

                    <p>
                      The page structure as well is important to the set up and function of the Website, the index.html file is usually the home page, anything after that should be distinguished decisively to ensure smooth surfing and crawlability by Google, Bing or Amazon search Engines or crawlers. High fast response should also be given priority as this would definitely affect Google ranking of the Website. The Page Structure must also follow a distinguished pattern, usually starts with the head section which contains the Meta Tag information’s and other important links before moving to the Body which could contain Divisions, or Sections to support the Website and end with a Footer section, to give basic important facts and information’s as well as links of the website.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With all said, and explained, the process of attaining a fully effective SEO’s operation on a Website can be quite difficult, but not impossible, all it requires is a well sort out knowledge of SEO’s and Meta Tags and the discipline to follow through with this requirements and in no time an high ranking Google search page would be achieved.
