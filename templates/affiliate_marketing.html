                      If you ask any website manager or blogger how they generate sustainable income from post and contents on their websites or blogs, most of them would tell you, it’s actually the result of advertising as the major source of income, monetization of traffic, or getting personalized advert contracts etc. Advert placement on web contents and blog post can be indeed lucrative with the generation of passive and sustainable income. However, this would have to deal with the use of Search Engine Optimization (S.E.O) and promotion for new website keen to establish their dominance of the World Wide Web and for older websites or blogs hoping to maintain relevance, the publishing of exquisite contents guaranteed to generate massive traffic, or the use of promotions on various social media spaces using Hash Tags and directing the contents to targeted audience, some go as far as sending emails and direct messages just to get the desired flow of traffic, however this principles may apply, it goes not always guarantee an increase in traffic flow to a website or blog post; if anything, writing an informative, plagiarism free, well articulated post would do better to address this issues, as long as it as a targeted audience in view.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Another problem with the use of Advert agencies is the time taken to get approval for both new and old websites owning to the problem of contents and policies. Advert agencies like Google Adsesne, and the likes would scrutinize websites and blogs submitted to them and afterwards reject their offers with no credible reason in the emails sent or the Adsense account leaving website managers and bloggers to scamper for help in the most unlikely manner and unlikely place, not to mention the operational duration needed for a website or blog to have been operated before considering applying for Adsense. For new websites and blogs hoping to start generating income as soon as possible, applying for Google Adsense is not an option. Adsense takes pride in its post of various webpage’s and would require a certain level of traffic, post as well as authenticity of post before approval, also the number of months in operation is a requirement. For website within a month old or three of publication or establishment, it can be very difficult to get Adsense approval and even if older than eight month, there is still the issue of meeting up with the cookie policies and privacy policies of Adsense, with two keen policies to look out for which are;

                      <li>European Union User Consent Policy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      However difficult this may be, it is not impossible, all it requires are deliberate research on how to set up a privacy policy content that suits this requirements.

                    <p>

The very first thing to be on the lookout for is the Audience, as this goes a long way in generating traffic and a perfect passive income.

These principles also goes along with that of Affiliate Marketing, if a Website is built solely to give updates on tech and programming, then for affiliate marketing, agencies like Amazon, Vana-Plus, Jumia, and the likes that offer this services should be the target, if it is a blog established to give updates of trending topics, and post individual articles capable of getting content writing gig and the likes, affiliate program like Fiverr, or Upwork should be considered, and if you hope to promote Ebooks or an online Library Resource, Amazon Kindle should not be left out of the mix.
