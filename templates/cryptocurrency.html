                    <p>
                      There is not a soul alive today that isn’t aware of the digital and crypto market with millions of investors and billions of dollars invested in this platform from its start a while back in 2009. The leading and first crypto currency, the Bitcoin has been a sensational talk on various social media. Various platforms as been designed to accommodate its operations and ensure all-round performance throughout the globe. The invention of other crypto assets came through as well following the success of this leading platform used in various payment structures and for various payment transactions. However the crypto world as also witness a large scale down trend in its flow following its reach of an all time high of $60,000 [sixty thousand dollars] and a subsequent fall to $32,000 [thirty two thousand dollars], it is still believed that with this fall, the Crypto world would recover and become better than ever before, reaching a predicted all time high of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Following recent trends and boom in the crypto world one could undoubtedly predict a flow in its investment and policy formation. It experienced a great boom from its previous price of $35,000[thirty five thousand dollars] to $42,000 [forty two thousand dollars] with future prediction of the price reaching an all time high of $100,000 [one hundred thousand dollars], this prediction is seeming to come true with the price of the Bitcoin souring to a whopping forty six thousand dollars ($46,000) and from analysis flow it could very much still sour high. With the latest updates coming from the crypto world it is however still very unlikely to predict if it is a good time to trade or hold, not to mention the bad times it had gone through in the past with a major crash in the past year. The leading crypto coin, the Bitcoin suffered a great crash with its investors suffering great loss, coupled with the ban on its operations in several countries of the international community; this has not deterred some individuals from investing in its platform and purchasing Crypto assets using proxy means and peer to peer transactions. With all this dark, ghostly transactions taking place behind the scene and against various bans accompanied by various acceptance as major payment methods, the Bitcoin is still very much powerful with the ability to make millionaires and billionaires of this present generation; however this process could be risky and lucrative if done the right way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With all this said and done, one major question comes to mind; how do one gain massive income and profits from the Crypto Verse?
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Holding Crypto Assets in Crypto Wallets</h4>

                    <p>
                      Holding Crypto assets in crypto wallets can be very lucrative, imagine this, buying certain assets of crypto numbering 20 at a lower rates of five dollars ($5) which would cost an hundred dollars ($100) and within the next few days, few weeks or few months a boom and sudden increase to twenty dollars ($20) per asset, that’s a profit of three hundred dollars $300 and an investment well placed. However losses may occur if the price or worth of the assets reduces; for example, a reduction in price to about two dollars ($2) per assets or even a greater reduction. Therefore holding crypto assets can be lucrative if the right investments are made, or could go the direct opposite.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Trading Crypto Assets</h4>
                    <p>
                      You need to note that the principles of holding also affects Crypto trading except if your traded assets include USDT (United State Dollar Tether), as this have a fixed price ranging between five hundred and eighty six dollars ($586) to five hundred and ninety dollars ($590). Trading peers could sometimes lead to loss; as such peers traded for another could experience a sudden hike or drop in price; for example; “let’s say the traded peers were BTC (the Bitcoin) and BNB (Binance Coin), if the worth of 450 Binance coin could purchase 225 Bitcoin and a trade is made only to discover that there is an increase in the worth of the Binance Coin and 450 of its assets could now purchase 300 Bitcion, then the transaction which gave 225 Bitcoin led to a loss, as the worth of the Bitcoin won’t be enough to purchase 450 Binance assets and vice versa”; either way Crypto trading is still lucrative if done properly with the right knowledge on how to trade this assets.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Best Crypto Assets to Hold or Trade</h4>

                    <p>
                      There are a lot of crypto wallets to facilitate the purchase of crypto assets, holding, transfer or withdrawal of these assets, deciding on the best wallets would depend on certain principles with one major consideration being the choice of the individual. Also security considerations should be top on this list, as crypto assets are prone to cyber attacks which may lead to loss of assets. Also speed of transaction and guaranteed of flexibility in verification processes would go a long way in making a decision on the best Crypto wallets to choose for holding Crypto assets as such verification processes could be sometimes cumbersome and could take a lot of time to get done.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">The Risks of Investing Crypto Currency</h4>

                    <p>
                      The Forex market as a risk warning on the investments of capital which could be lost in the process of trading, this risk warning is not restricted to the Forex market alone, as the Crypto Verse is also part of this reality, at any point there could be a cyber attack, or a sudden dip in worth, or loss of pass code, or wallet key, or seizure of proceeds from the sales or transactionery profits of Crypto assets by the financial institutions. Crypto Investment is not without its risk, but the ability to manage such risk is what guarantees a successful trading or holding profitable operation in the Crypto Verse.
