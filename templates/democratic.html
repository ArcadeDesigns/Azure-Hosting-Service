                      Nigeria over the years has been an exemplary image of democracy on the African continent upholding every principles of its system which includes; the principles of the fundamental human right, in line with the universal declaration (UDHR, 1945), the principles of legitimacy, independence of the judiciary and the electoral commission, as well as the conduct of a free and fair periodic election. Dated back to the year 1999, after years of military rule, Nigeria conducted an election which brought in the first democratically elected president, retired General Chief Olusegun Obasanjo into the office of the presidency, for a two term tenure. Under his rule, Nigeria experienced a lot of growth and development spanning from his rule to the rule of the late Umar Yara Dua, and that of the former president, Ebele Goodluck Jonathan and the incumbent president retired General Muhammadu Buhari. Although every elected president of the nation as added their quota to the growth of democracy in Nigeria as well as ensure its continuity in the nation and beyond, enjoying various levels of international co-operation and integration as a result of this effort, Nigeria’s role in democratic consolidation on the African continent can never be over emphasized.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      However, in recent years, the nation has been bedeviled with various challenges to spanning from the political sector to the economic sector and the socio-cultural aspect of the country. Politically, Nigeria was once described as a “fantastically corrupt nation” by the former British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, not far fetch though as this is due to the depth of corruption in various ministries of the country with most state actors and political head, having their hands in the cookie jar. Economically, Nigeria was once recognized as the fastest growing economy on the African Continent, with the highest Gross Domestic Production (GDP) ratio on the same African continent overtaking South Africa in the leadership seat., however this claims have been questioned following series of economic woes that as encountered the country ranging from the high cost of production, to the high cost of living, to high inflation rate and an increase in the unemployment ratio to the fall of the Naira, Nigeria’s national currency to the Dollar. Some may argue that the reason for this could be linked to the global drop in the price of crude oil, which is Nigeria’s major source of revenue, the truth remains that the country is facing a lot of economic hardship. Although there have been efforts by the Government to diversify the country’s economy with the creation of indigenous factories to process local Agricultural Produce and partnering with foreign companies and nations to improve the exportation of some of this agricultural produce which includes; Cotton, Cocoa, Palm Oil, Ground Nuts, Cashew Nuts and so on. In the year 2020 alone, Nigeria export 321.5 billion naira worth of agricultural products, however this impressive improvement was met by an increase in Importation, which impacted the country’s economy negatively. Sadly even with all this achievements, every economic prosperity seems to be down the drain, with human right guarantee at its lowest, and an increased clamour for separation from secessionist, there is also an outcry against the Nigerian police force, particularly, the special anti robbery squad (SARS) for illegal extortion, and inhumane treatment of innocent citizens, and with an increase in insecurity, kidnapping and banditry in the country, one may wonder what is the future of Nigeria’s Democratic consolidation as every principles of democracy are not being held, and the future of the country is still very much uncertain.
                    </p>

                      According to Abraham Lincoln, Democracy is the government of the people for the people and by the people. A closer scrutiny of the statement points towards the reality that democracy is simply the government of the people., and in line with that to guarantee, full democracy in a country, the government must be legitimate, with periodic election and an independent electoral commission and an Independent Judiciary, sadly reverse in the case in Nigeria, with mass corruption and compromise of duty, Nigeria’s democratic consolidation is hanging by a thread, sadly the federal government has become too powerful and too dangerous to remain as such. A notable example would be the electoral act amendment bill which was vetoed by the President retired General Nuhammadu Buhari. Nigeria’s democratic consolidation is slowly slipping away and with the 2023 general election by the corner, the fear of many concerning the result and aftermath of the elections has risen. First is in the issue of insecurity. The Nigerian Military has been battling with the Islamic terrorist group, the Boko Haram Insurgents, since 2009, which has metamorphosed into the Islamic State of west African province (ISWAP), with no external aid of troops, and to add to it is the issue of Banditry which has become a menace, out of control with kidnapping now a lucrative means of income for this recently labelled terrorist group, the Nigerian Military is straight thin, and with the Nigerian Police Force incapable of facing this menace or that of the secessionist group in the west and eastern part of Nigeria, insecurity is guarantee at an all time high could spell doom for the 2023 General Election. Democracy guarantees’ the majority rule and the minority supports, however serving as a watchdog to prevent autocratic rule as been negated by statements like the kings maker turn to rule, the issue of God fathers in politics. The issue of godfatherism, a dependent electoral commission and a dependent judiciary which is the last hope of the common man. The legitimacy of the government that will assume office after the 2023 general election might be said to be less legitimate. If the future election ids having some many future fears already how can Nigeria’s democracy be guaranteed?
