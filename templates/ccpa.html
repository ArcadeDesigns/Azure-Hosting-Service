                      When it comes to website policies concerning the usage and collection of data, there are certain policies to put in mind, ranging from the Terms of Usage and Services to Cookie Policies, Privacy Policies, or Disclaimer post, all this details are necessary and very important.

                      Google Adsense is known to give out extremely high rate on clicks, impressions and traffic. The rates generated by Google Adsense are the highest in the service of Ads placement on websites and blogs; for every 1000 clicks $4.5 would be added to the account, if this is calculated by 100,000 clicks that would bring in $405 with a monthly payout clause, the more reasons to generate organic traffic and avoid plagiarism of contents and images as plagiarism and fake clicks are major reason for the rejection or suspension of a website in the Adsense program. The process of Google Adsense approval required for admission into the Adsense program ranges from the following requirements that must have been met by the website before application. The requirement includes: a minimum of 20 posts on the website and this post must be 100% authentic and free of plagiarism, at least three month of operations for the website to be approved, and the most important are the Privacy Policies.

The privacy policies are so important, even certain Ads agencies and affiliate marketing platform won’t admit websites or blogs without this assurance. In the case of Google Adsense, beyond the Privacy Policies, Terms of Service and Disclaimer post, there are two Privacy Policies that should be added in the privacy policy section, GPRA policies for users from the EU and the California Privacy Policy quote (CCPA and GPRA policies). The CCPA (California Privacy Policy) is in line with the California Law, which protects residence of California from illegal activities and falling victims to illegal websites. This policies are used to make websites and blogs liable to law actions if found in contempt of this laws and ensure its users and residence protection. It also helps the Adsense program to ascertain serious Websites from the fake ones seeking to gather users information.
