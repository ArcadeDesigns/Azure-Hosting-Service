                      Content writers are one of the most paid writers in the world; you get paid to do what you see as a passion, converted into a means of livelihood. When it comes to content writing, a wide range of knowledge concerning various aspects of life and topics affecting the world at large is required.

Content writing is just like every other writing gig that requires a great length of research and understanding of the subject matter to ascertain full comprehension. If writing a report on a subject matter, trying to pass useful information and bring to light useful details of a forgotten knowledge or trend.

                    <p>
                      Trying to differentiate between content writing and other writings can be quite tricky, however this maybe, all writing principles follows the same route, research, targeted audience, understanding the subject matter, and then the writing. For example, a blog created to support traveling and tourism, giving regular updates of international travels regulations and the best places to travel or visit in the summer, winter or spring, such post would definitely require a certain level as research, as it must be precise and be a vivid representation of what is reality and not what is expected.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Writing Articles on the other hand is very much different as this requires in-depth analysis and detailed writing of what is expected to be written on. Articles are usually written to make understanding known and share an ideology, very different from content writing, however distinctive this maybe from content writing, articles are similar to it and can be generalized in line with all the writing aspect particularly related to web contents, blog posts and other online aspects of information dissemination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Also inclusive in content writing are book reviews, a little bit like product description or product specifications, writing Book Reviews required study of the book to be written on and then a candid view of the book setting, plot, and scenery as well as characters personalization and descriptions. All in all, reviewing a book more like product description writing is also a part of Content Writing. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Managing a Website also requires Content writing skills especially if this site is in relation to Book and Library resources. As earlier stated when discussing Book Reviews, content writing are also a part of this process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Content writing in the end is a field that possesses the potential to generate massive income and in doing so requires skill. Either managing a website or writing blog post, or article contents right down to product specification and descriptions, content writing, broad as it may be, can be very lucrative regardless.
