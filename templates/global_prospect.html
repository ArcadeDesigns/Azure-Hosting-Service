                      When it comes to the foreign sphere of nations and the assembly in court to pursue foreign policy and promote national interest, objects of thoughts like treaties, diplomatic ties, alliance, and espionage comes to light. However secretive this principles maybe and kept far away from public view and public reach, the fact remains that it still exist and constitute a big part of the world survival and maintenance of global peace and fostering of global unity. Countries of the world at one time or the other resulted to unconventional means to fulfill their foreign policy and satisfy its national interest, however selfish it may sound the principle of foreign policy dictate national interest first and everything else.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the case of the conflict presently ravaging Eastern Europe, it is filled with mixed reactions and trolling details of what maybe a mistake and security laps or protection of territorial integrity as it is no longer News, the steps Russia as taken to fulfill and satisfy its national interest; in this case alleged defense of territorial integrity from alleged Western incursion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The issue on going in Eastern Europe; “The Invasion of Ukraine by Russia” as seen the European Union come together under one voice to condemn this act of violence and unprovoked aggression. Sadly the world is divided on this issue, the views of some blaming the western media for extensive report on the issue trying to stir up sympathy vote, while other relating to the issue of humanitarian crises stemming from the conflict and the reality of being trapped in a war zone, however this realities maybe the fact remains we are human first and every act of violence and aggression is a stain on the world history’s never to be wiped off or forgotten.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ukraine, the victim of this violent aggression has cried out for help hoping the western allies, NATO, and the EU would rush to its aid, sadly this is not the case, two months into the conflict and Ukraine is left alone to fend off the invading Russian Forces and protects its territorial integrity from this incursion while NATO and the EU continues to place crippling sanctions on Russia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Like history repeating itself, but in this case the Germans and Russians were actors from a scene in the second war world (WW II) play book under Hitler and Stalin respectively, in what was seen as a movement to attack an enemy through the Russian border known as the USSR (United Sovereign Socialist Republics) at the time of this event turned out to be an attack on them and invaded deep into their territory crippling the Russian Forces to a near defeat. Of course International relations was there ready to play its role in the area of alliance under the allied force which fought the Germans for the majority of the Second World War (WW II) until the end as since change its rules of engagement.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">The Role of International Politics</h4>

                    <p>
                      International politics, a fancy name for foreign policy as established the fact that a country only establish bilateral or multilateral relations when it favor either parties or both parties economically or promises to promote science and technology, either way, there is always a gain. Pursuing National Interest at the global scene is every countries foreign policy and a major guide in international relations or international politics, how countries trade with one another, relates with one and another, joins or exit a global or regional bloc, establish alliance, regulate price during international trade, all are guides in international politics. Understanding how all this policies affects relationship would indeed help one understand why NATO and the EU as opt for sanctions rather than an all out conflict in a bid to safe Ukraine from Russian aggression. Basically the war going on in Europe could spill into a global crisis if not checked with proper care, and the attempt to avoid the incidence of global war has been a step well taken to rather sanction Russia and cripple its ability to wage war, if this succeed then we could see an end to what could spill into a global conflict which would most certainly guarantee the use of Nuclear weapons among Super Powers.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading"> Ukraine past Global Influence and the Path to Join the Capitalist Nation </h4>

                    <p>
                      Ukraine used to be a part of the USSR and was at one point in time the third largest nuclear power in the world until it signed a deal with the United States and Russia where is relinquished all its Nuclear power for the assurance of safety and security as well as Territorial Integrity to practice its system of government as a sovereign independent nation. However its historical background of being a former Socialist state still haunts its ambition to be a part of NATO and establish a strong alliance with the United States. This is coupled with the fact that the United States respect the sovereignty of European Countries and their stance against external incursion as an attack to one is an attack to all, making them strong when united and a terror for any invading force. There is also the fact that Ukraine tying to be a part of the Capitalist Bloc would mean a neighboring Capitalist state bordering Russia, send with a strong warning of NATO alliance backing them up, this rivalry would send Russia military strength sinking and as rules are set in International trades with National Currencies being a legal tender, in international politics, power, either soft or Hard power (Military Strength), is the currency for dominance and maintenance of economic power in the World. As a result it is not hard to fathom Russia claim of Capitalist incursion and the United States fears of a United Europe fighting its agenda for expansion. Furthermore, there is the fear of Military alliance between Ukraine and the United States, which reminds the world of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia just some few years back in 2014, which led to the annexation of the Crimean region by Russia. If Ukraine was a part of NATO or was in a military alliance with the United States, Russia won’t dare to invade Ukraine, plus there is the risk of an all out war where Russia would be caught in the middle of a NATO force and EU alliances.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading"> Economic Sanctions Placed on Russia and its Effect on the EU </h4>

                    <p>
                      Every countries life line would be its Economic Strength, with a strong economy; a country can wage war for decades, purchase weaponries, and create sophisticated advanced technologies capable of mass destruction, if Ukraine was to be a part of NATO, imagine just how easy it would be for the United States to carry out espionage and economic sabotage in Russia, a great fear for one of Europe’s power house and second strongest military in the world. Thus buttressing Russia’s fears once more. And on the part of the European Union, a direct confronted with Russia would mean the cutoff of gas supply to a majority of European countries and a great defect on Russia’s economy but a greater disaster for the European Countries. As earlier stated the annexation of the Crimean Region back in 2014 was a well contested events that led to a victory for Russia, however there are still many regions being contested for in Ukraine, and as a result Russia can boldly move into this regions with its military might in a bid to annex more Ukrainian regions, as long as it remains out of NATO and any other military alliance, thus the annexation of more Ukrainian territory by Russia in the spirit of a military conquest through territorial encroachment would satisfy Russia expansion dreams and one step to forming its USSR glory days once more with large deposit of natural resources.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      After the Second World War (WW II) outcome, two super powers, The United States and its allies, and the USSR came into play, and ushered in a new dispensation, the Cold War era fought across countries and continents in the shadow space away from public views, using espionage as a tool for Economic sabotage, Military sabotage, technological sabotage and covert cover ups at the end of it all. These countries fought for global supremacy and this fight was unending until the late 70s when the word saw global co-operation and unity for many years until this moment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In conclusion, the thought of a global conflict is quite scary and so is the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the killings of civilians is also heart breaking. The EU and NATO as decided economic crippling sanctions on Russia, however there are fears that this may not be enough and Ukraine may fall into Russia’s hands. The place of International Politics in all this is the policy of Non-Aggression towards an Aggressive state like Russia already using military force in Ukraine with a subtle question on the mind of expert analyst and Political, Military and Global Politics experts;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      What if Ukraine falls and Russia turns its eyes towards Poland which is a part of NATO, would there be an all out War or would it still be Economic Sanctions?
